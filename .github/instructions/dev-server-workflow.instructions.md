# Local Dev Server Workflow

- Do not start local development servers by default.
- Assume the user usually already has the relevant dev server running.
- Before running commands such as `pnpm dev`, `next dev`, `vite`, `npm run dev`, `just <app>-dev`, or similar long-lived local servers, ask the user to start the server or confirm that no server is already running.
- Only start a dev server yourself when the user explicitly asks you to do that.
- When you need runtime verification and no server is available, prefer asking the user to start the correct app server instead of launching one on their behalf.
